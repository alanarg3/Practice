#Linked Lists

This code is form a homework assignment about linked lists from the class COE322 at UT Austin.
In this code, linked lists are visualized with numbers and arrows.
First, the program goes through several excersizes to check if the program works given different inputs.
Then, the user is allowed to input numbers to test the program themselves. If a number is inputted by the user, then it is added in the list in order. If that number already exists, the count of the list goes up.

Files included:
1. LinkedLists.cpp- this is main function
2. LinkedListsHeader.h- this program contains the declarations and class methods
3. LinkedListsImplementation- this program contains all function definitions
