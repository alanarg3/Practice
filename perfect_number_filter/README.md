This program was homework from the class COE322 at UT Austin.

This is a C++ code that practices range based iteration to find all perfect numbers below a certain upper bound. Perfect numbers are numbers that are the sum of their factors (excluding itself).
Ex. factors of 6 include 1, 2, 3, 6; and 6 = 3 + 2 + 1.
